Heavy-Fraction version 1.00
===========================

This is Heavy::Fraction, an example XS module containing the heavy_fraction
example, and several others.

See 'Fraction.xs' for the XS code examples, and the 't' directory for a suite
of tests that exercise the various functions defined in this module. The
Perl part of the module is in lib/Heavy/Fraction.pm (it is unmodified apart
from making the functions provided by Fractions.xs available for export).

BUILDING AND TESTING

To exercise the XS code in this module, build it and use the 'make test'
target with the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

Look at the test scripts in the 't' subdirectory to see what the test
target actually does.

INSTALLATION

It is doubtful that you would want to install this module, but in the
unlikely event that you do, type the following additional command:

   make install
