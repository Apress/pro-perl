This is the source code archive for Pro Perl, ISBN 1-59059-438-X.
(version 1.0, created 2005/3/1)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the examples are designed to be run in place wherever the archive is
unpacked - no installation is necessary.

Every example in the archive additionally contains a page reference, which 
gives the location of the example in the book.  Some additional examples have
been placed in the archive to exercise code that does not cite a test program
in the text.  These examples are marked 'additional' along with the closest
applicable page reference.

Some examples need files as input to function.  Suitable input files have been
provided (whether given in the text or not) for these examples. Each file is
noted in an additional comment line near the top of the example program that
uses it.
