Serial version 1.00
===================

This is Serial, an example XS module containing the newserial and
number examples. Two versions are presented here:

newserial and number manage a serial_t struct passed as a pointer,
with the value being opaque to the scalar reference that points to it
within Perl

newserial_nonptr and number_nonptr manage a serial_t struct passed
by value, and make use of the T_SERIAL mappings in the 'typemap'
file to convert the struct to and from a Perl hash reference.

BUILDING AND TESTING

To exercise the XS code in this module, build it and use the 'make test'
target with the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

Look at the test scripts in the 't' subdirectory to see what the test
target actually does.

INSTALLATION

It is doubtful that you would want to install this module, but in the
unlikely event that you do, type the following additional command:

   make install
